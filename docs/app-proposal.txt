PROPOSAL:
We're creating a proto-social-media app.
Users will be able to register an account with an email and password, which they can use to log into said account.

Once logged in, users can write text posts and then publish them to the website, where they'll appear with other posts on a webpage.
The accounts and associated information will be stored by way of an SQL-controlled database. The application will use a combination of JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS programming languages to connect front and back ends.
